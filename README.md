# CoreNLPClient.Net

## Summary

CoreNLPClient.Net is a C# client for Stanford CoreNLP Java server. You need a fully functional version of both CoreNLP and Java in your computer to run the client. See https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/corenlp-server.html for further information.

According the project documentation, using a client talking to a server instance is the best way to implement an interface to CoreNLP in other programming languages.

There are several client implementations in many programming languages. The official from the Stanford NLP Group is a Python project called Stanza. https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/index.html

To keep things simple, I try to mimic the Stanza interface and implementation whenever possible.
